# Validate

A project to eliminate cyber crime:-

Cybercrime is a growing issue in India and with the exponential growth in technology the crime rates are also at a rise. The criminals involved in cybercrime often showcase themselves as government agents and aslo make fake government websites to lure people into the trap of phishing. To solve this issue our team proposes a validation system for government websites and government bank accounts using VALIDATE.

# What is Validate ?

Validate is an idea for a verification system which will verify government and bank webpages for their legitimacy using the database consisting of official URLs of these webpages.

Validate will also show that the digital transactions made to any account is a government owned account or not which will eliminate the cyber crimes involving fake government schemes and fake bank schemes.
